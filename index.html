	<h1 style="color:#6a1b9a;">The Four Seasons Where I Grew Up</h1>
	<p style="background-color:#e3f2fd;">I was raised in the Midwest, where the seasons are distinct and each brings its own character to the landscape and daily life. The changing seasons have always marked the rhythm of the year for me, shaping my activities, moods, and memories. Each season means something special, and my likes and dislikes are shaped by the experiences I've had growing up in a place where the weather can be both a joy and a challenge.</p>

	<h2 class="season-heading spring">Spring</h2>
	<p>Spring in the Midwest is a time of renewal and hope. I love watching the world come back to life after the long, cold winter. The trees bud, flowers bloom, and the air is filled with the scent of fresh rain. However, spring can also be unpredictable, with sudden storms and chilly days that make it hard to fully enjoy the outdoors. Despite the mud and allergies, I appreciate the energy and optimism that spring brings.</p>

	<h2 class="season-heading summer">Summer</h2>
	<p>Summer is vibrant and full of activity. I enjoy the long days, warm sunshine, and opportunities for swimming, hiking, and family barbecues. The heat can be intense, and sometimes the humidity makes it uncomfortable, but I love the freedom and fun that summer offers. Mosquitoes and sunburns are definite downsides, but the memories of fireworks, ice cream, and late-night walks make summer a favorite season for me.</p>

	<h2 class="season-heading autumn">Autumn</h2>
	<p>Autumn is my favorite season. The crisp air, colorful leaves, and the smell of bonfires create a cozy and nostalgic atmosphere. I love wearing sweaters, drinking hot cider, and celebrating holidays like Halloween and Thanksgiving. The shorter days and the knowledge that winter is coming can be a little sad, but the beauty and comfort of autumn always lift my spirits.</p>

	<h2 class="season-heading winter">Winter</h2>
	<p>Winter in the Midwest is both beautiful and challenging. I enjoy the peacefulness of fresh snow and the excitement of the holiday season. Sledding and building snowmen are fun, but the cold, icy roads, and long stretches of gray days can be tough to handle. I dislike the bitter wind and the hassle of shoveling snow, but winter also brings moments of quiet reflection and family togetherness that I cherish.</p>
